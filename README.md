# Company-Employees-Database
A .NET web includes a databse of the information of the employees working for a company with multiple departments.

## How it was done
It was built so that it consists of three main parts :
- Using the designed pattern MVC with the programming language C# , I created a model for the 'Employee' and another one
for the 'Department', and a controller for each to handle any action taken from the user.
- A good looking web with a front end created using HTML and bootstrap toolkit. Here is the where the user can take 
any CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) action. 
- SQL server as the database managment, containing the data of the employees, the departments, and the relationship between them. The models controllers can get access to the data in the help of the migrations.

## Tasks to be done
- [x] Create employee and department models.
- [x] Create a SQL server with the desired data you need to CRUD.
- [x] Create a controller for the employee and department models.
- [x] Assign the controllers with the SQL server using migrations.
- [x] Create a view for every page you need to display for the user.
